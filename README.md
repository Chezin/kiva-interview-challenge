# Kiva interview challenge

- This application was created using create-react-app as a boilerplate.
- For the API calls I decided to use Axios, since that makes calling something from GraphQL a bit easier and way less verbose than vanilla js' fetch
- As for the UI, Material seemed to be the best choice to use too, seeing that it is very easily customizable
